# Laravel Dev Environment with Docker
## What's this
This repo was created by following Andrew Schmelyun's [tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I980aPL-NRM).
This will help organize your laravel dev by running nginx, php & mysql, and even compose, artisan & npm in a container.
Therefore you don't have to install these services, and have multiple version of them on your host machine
